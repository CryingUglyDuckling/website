				If you meet hundred people today and ask them how was your life till now? Ninety people will say it was not easy.
				If you ask them if they are happy now. Most people will say they are not. Few will say it was hard but they are happy now.
				They had to go through alot to come to this point. 80% of the worlds population are not happy.
				Rest of the 20% are happy right now but will hardly accept life was easy. Only 5% will say life was easy for them and they are happy now.
				I am among those 5%. I believe I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth. God almighty gave me more than I deserve.       
			</p>
			<p>
				One day one of my friend was very upset I asked him why? He said his father would not buy him an Iphone. I said 'but you already have a functional samsung which was quite costly.
				Why would you need an Iphone.' He said all of his friends have Iphones. That time I was using a symphony which was around six thousand (taka obviously). I never felt the need to buy a better phone
				let alone an IPhone. Then I realized something. I name this story  
			</P>
			<h4 class="w3-center" style="color:red">The silver spoon</h4>
			<p>
				When a person is born God gives two things to the person. One, He puts a spoon in the mouth and two, he gives every person a special power.
				With that power the person can change the material of the spoon. It can be made of silver, wood, gold, or anything.
				Moreover you can change the material of the spoon anytime of your life. 
				Even if you are old if you had a wooden spoon through out your life you can change that spoon to silver anytime you want.
				The spoon can be silver only if you believe it to be.
			</p>
			<p>
				I never felt the need of Iphone or Macbook. I was happy with what I had. Before I continue more of the story I need to tell you something about myself.
				I am a CSE graduate have sufficient knowledge on the subject. I like the idea of earning money through freelancing. I made few games, websites, apps. 
				While planning to release an app on playstore I had to run a survey and analyze the app market. I found Iphone apps make 4times the playstore apps inspite of the number of apps in apple's appstore
				being one-fourth of Google's Playstore. I realized Iphone users pay more than android users. I ask myself why should I limit my app to Google's playstore? 
				I decided to make the app for both playstore and appstore. While Developing for the apple I found out two things. One you have to use MACBOOK to make the app. 
				Two, Its better to buy Iphone for testing the app. Moreover you can make both Iphone apps and andoind apps on MACBOOK but you can not legally do both in other laptops.
				I asked my father to buy me an IPHONE and a MACBOOK. Father said why do you need another mobile and another laptop. Be satisfied with what you already have.
				Then I looked at my spoon. I asked myself is it still a silver one?.....    
			</P>
			<p style="color:red">
				...... YES it is.

					There are differences between research and project. Sometimes a project may not be a research. For example making a website can not be a researh.
					As we know the result of it. A website building such as facebook is a project. Where as accurate face detection in a picture uploaded in facebook is a research.
					Result of research is unknown. where as project invloves just assembly. A research is always a project but a project may not always be a research.
					Below here are some of my projects and researches. Right now I wont be sharing the technical stuffs. I will be sharing just a gist of my works.

				</p>
				<p>
					To be honest most of my researches failed.

					By clicking any thumnail to view any project below you agree that you will not be stealing any of my idea. Haha just Kidding. You can steal any project you like.
					Most of my projects are based on engineering implementaion. So getting the idea will not help you to implement it. I am happy to collaborate if someone is interested to work with me. Just Dont steal The <span style="color:white">LUNASPHERE</span> project.
					I hold that project very close to my heart.

						The idea is to display a person wearing the dresses of his/her choosing on a computer screen.
						The dress will be responsive according to the posture of human.
						It was based on augmented reality.  
					</p>
					<h2>Inspiration</h2>
					<hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
					<p>
						It was not my idea. One of my talented younger sister Tahmina Sultana was participating in a compettiion named
						Woman in DIgital. She presented the idea named dress mirror. People can choose the dress from the screen and they see themselves on that dress.
						Tahomina approached me. It was a good idea but was very very hard to implement. Why was it hard I will describe later on. That time I was working with OPENCV. So I took the challenge.
						It had lots of potential. It helps alot in women's privacy in dressing rooms. This technology could have made dressing rooms obsolete.
					</p>
					<h2>Behind the camera</h2>
					<hr style="width:300px" class="w3-opacity">
					<p>
						We had a working prototype but could not manage to secure fund. To be honest I had doubts of its success. Tahomina approached companies like Yellow, Aarong.
						Yellow were interested for the technology. But to make it successful we needed a minimum investment of 10 lakhs just for trial and error. I will just give you an idea why was it not successful.
						The present games use heavy graphics yet very few can make it close to real despite of having high quality graphics card.
						We are not only simulating 3d cloths and folds along with light and shade We also have to detect the right posture. Only two companies in the world came close to implementing what we targeted.
						Not only that making 3d design of the dresses were quite costly. Inspite of all the challengs we managed to build a working prototype and also a business model which would require 10lakhs with 50% success rate.
						So you can guess what happened.

								This is a simple cross Platformer game. The story is about the love story of a firefly and an apple. Where firefly loses energy in sunlight and apple loses its energy without sunlight.
								The game contains many obstacles where firefly and apple have to solve together to be united in each others arm.

							Its another fail story. It was made for Imagine cup. Unfortunately when it was made the competition category for games were called off.

							In this verse fireflies eat apple for survival. But the main character of the game a firefly fell in Love with an apple and all the fireflies were against it. 
							They can never be together cos there can not be a place where light and dark both exist at the same time. But prophecy says in the lunas mountain a firefly can gain power 
							to withstand light. Then firefly and apple set their journey to Lunas mountain but the journey wont be easy because no one ever made it alive.

						<h2>Abstract</h2>
						<hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
						<p>
						The project gives us the estimated result of the human posture in three dimensional system from two dimensional color images with the help of multiple image processing techniques. 
						The input image has some specific criteria for being suitable candidate. The image should only contain single human with distinguishable face feature. 
						The position and size of the face is estimated from haar cascade technique. 
						The result provides us a stickman in 3d space. The estimated position of the body parts of the human are calculated using a conditional tree. 
						This technology is open for research and it can be used to understand the action of human.
						</p>
						<h2>Inspiration</h2>
						<hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
						<p>
							Most of the available researches used machine learning algorithms to train their system for human posture detection. 
							One specific research used infrared camera to detect human posture. As human emits infrared light the camera 
							Their study used Markov Model for human posture detection. This technology is expensive. 
							The accuracy rate is comparatively high respect to other techniques but the process is very costly and time consuming. 
						</p>
						<h2>Behind the camera</h2>
						<hr style="width:300px" class="w3-opacity">
						<p>
						This technology opens doors to enormous possibility. Lots of expensive sensors are used for motion tracking. 
						With this technology we can reduce those expenses by using only cameras. People make animation cartoon models and create their movement. 
						If we can bridge this technology with animation. Animators do not have to make their cartoons move in computer, anyone can do that using cameras. 
						In movies we use green background for CGI. 
						We can use any background screen other than skin color screen to detect human posture using this technology

						<h2>Abstract</h2>
						<hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
						<p>
						In this project we present an algorithm for cluster detection using modified Watershed model. 
						The key idea is to differentiate the areas and select their regions using modified watershed model. 
						Points included in those area are then differentiated according to their respective area. 
						Presented modified watershed model for cluster detection works better than the K-means Algorithm for cluster detection. 
						The presented algorithm is also computationally inexpensive compared to the K-means, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN algorithms. The Clustering results can be considered as good as the results of DBSCAN and sometimes the result obtained by the provided modified watershed model Clustering is better than the DBSCAN results. The presented algorithm also somewhat solves the conflicts faced by the DBSCAN in case of varying density. This paper also presents a way to reduce high dimensional data to low dimensional data with automatic association analysis. This algorithm can reduce high dimensional data to even a single dimension. Using this algorithm the conflicts faced in multidimensional clustering by different algorithms such as DBSCSN is solved. 
						This Dimensionality reduction with automatic association algorithm was then applied to the Watershed model to detect cluster in Homicide Data and finding out murder prone zones and suggest a person with murder avoiding areas.

						Clustering data has been a challenge in data mining field for a very long time. Many problems were faced during the establishment of clustering algorithm. Popular algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering are used abundantly for cluster detection with somewhat modifications [5]. Major researches on efficient initialization of K-means were also available [6]. But algorithms which are used abundantly in image processing has hardly been used for data mining. In this project we present a modified watershed model for cluster detection.

						Watershed model is mainly used for image processing for region detection. We modified the given watershed model for data clustering. In watershed model the key challenge is to find the most distinct points. This requirement is fulfilled by many techniques. Some renowned researches on watershed apply distance transform to achieve the expected result. Another way to achieve the result is through special filtering. We fulfilled this challenge applying multivariate Gaussian filter on the obtained image plot from the cluster dataset. A brief introduction on Watershed model is given followed by our modified algorithm

						<h2>Abstract</h2>
						<hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
						<p>
						In this paper we present a robot with mechanical gripper which has the capability of transporting limited sized objects from one place to another with pick-up and drop capabilities. The robot’s responses are based on speech recognition of verbal commands. In our project we have used Google speech recognition module in order to understand verbal commands. 
						We also categorized the objects into six specific categories according to the amount of gripping force required to lift the objects. The categories are divided according to object stiffness. An android application was used to communicate with the robot through Bluetooth communication. 
						</p>
						<h2>Inspiration</h2>
						<hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
						<p>
						The application decodes the human speech into an array of characters which are transmitted to the robot using Bluetooth technology. 
						The robot uses microcontroller which decodes the messages into executable functions. In this project we have designed the robot such that it understands only fifteen distinct verbal commands and ignores others.
						Being a speech responsive mobile robot it can be effectively used to move objects from one place to another by people with disability or handicap.
						</p>
						<h2>Behind the camera</h2>
						<hr style="width:300px" class="w3-opacity">
						<p>
							First, human speech command is picked up through an android application that uses Google speech recognition to convert the verbal command into an array of characters. 
							This array of characters is sent to the microcontroller on the robot using a Bluetooth module. The microcontroller receives the data, and processes it into an executable function. There are 15 functions that we have already defined for the robot to execute, such as moving forward or backward, picking up and dropping objects with only the force required, and so on. If the verbal command matches one of these predefined functions, that function is performed by the robot. If it does not match any of the functions preprogrammed, the robot does not perform any action.
